  {
    question: "What should I do if my pet has fleas or ticks?",

  },
  {
    question: "Why does my dog bark so much?",
    answer: "Dogs can bark for various reasons due to boredom, anxiety, excitement, or to alert you. You should definitely identify the trigger first. Keep your dog mentally and physically stimulated with toys, walks, and training. If anxiety causes it, you should consult a vet or professional trainer."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I tell if my cat is stressed?",
    answer: "Cats can express stress in subtle ways such as hiding, over-grooming, or changes in appetite. Create a calm, safe space for them, minimize changes in their environment, and consider using calming sprays or pheromones."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the signs of separation anxiety in pets?",

  },
  {
    question: "How can I tell if my pet is in pain?",
    answer: "Pets are skilled at hiding discomfort, but signs like limping, whining, reduced appetite, or avoiding touch might indicate pain. If you notice unusual behavior, schedule a vet visit‚Äîbetter to be cautious."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I feed my pet?",
    answer: "Choose a balanced diet appropriate for your pet's age, breed, and health. High-quality commercial food is usually a safe choice. If you prefer homemade meals, consult a vet or pet nutritionist to ensure the diet meets their nutritional needs."
  },
  {
    question: "How much exercise does my pet need?",
    answer: "Exercise requirements vary. Most dogs thrive with 30 minutes to 2 hours of activity daily, while cats enjoy short, playful bursts. Adjust based on your pet's age, breed, and health, and monitor for signs of fatigue or overexertion."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I bathe my pet?",
    answer: "Dogs generally need a bath every month unless they get especially dirty. Cats usually handle grooming themselves but may need a bath if they get into something sticky. Always use pet-specific shampoos."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I take care of my pet's teeth?",
    answer: "Brush your pet's teeth a few times a week with pet-safe toothpaste. Dental treats and chew toys can help reduce plaque. Regular dental checkups with your vet are essential to catching any issues early."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if my pet's nails are too long?",
    answer: "If you hear their nails clicking on the floor, it's time for a trim. Use pet nail clippers or grinders and be careful not to cut into the quick. If you're unsure, a vet or groomer can help."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I pet-proof my home?",
    answer: "Store chemicals, small objects, and toxic plants out of reach. Hide electrical cords and secure windows and balconies. Use covered trash cans and ensure your home is free of hazards that curious pets might explore."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I keep my pet safe during extreme weather?",
    answer: "In hot weather, keep your pet hydrated and limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours. In the cold, provide a warm indoor space and consider pet-safe boots or jackets for short-haired breeds. Monitor their comfort closely."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I keep my pet entertained when I'm away?",
    answer: "Interactive toys, puzzle feeders, and chew toys are great for keeping pets occupied. Calming music or a pet camera with a microphone can help them feel less alone. A morning play session or walk can also tire them out before you leave."
