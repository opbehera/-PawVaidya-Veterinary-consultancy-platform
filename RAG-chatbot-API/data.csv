Arthritis and Joint pain (Cats and Dogs),"Arthritis, which is also know as a Degenerative Joint Disease is one of the most common conditions which affects middle aged to senior dogs and cats. Cartilage is found lining the joints where it acts as a protective barrier. Unstable joint moves in an abnormal manner, eroding the cartilage faster than it can be replaced and eventually bones end up rubbing against each other leading mainly to inflammation and pain.","Degenerative Joint Disease has a very negative impact on the animal’s quality of life. The first signs that one can notice is that the cat or dog is very slow and not showing interest in daily activities such as walking up the stairs. This is because the pet is uncomfortable to move since it is painful. For cats it may be a little more difficult to recognise since they spend a lot of time sleeping, however defecating outside the litter box or excessive grooming could be some crucial signs.","Reluctant to walk, jump and run ;Limping ;Slowing down ;Urinating or defecating outside the litter box (a very useful sign for cats) ;Grooming excessively in one area (indicating focal arthritis pain) ;Trouble jumping ;Cats shows aggressive behaviour whilst dogs whimper when touched in the area ;Social desolation ;Lying down more often ;Stiffness ;Pain ;Inflammation",;Ageing ;Serious illness ;Trauma or Accidents ;Infection (septic arthritis),"Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents; carprofen, robenacoxib ;Steroids; prednisolone Arthritis is not curable however preventing further erosion is paramount, since it limits the chance of needing surgery in the future.","It is important to stipulate to the correct dosing and not try to adjust it to provide more pain relief. ;Be careful when purchasing any over-the-counter medication. ;Supplement your pet’s diet with omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, glucosamine and chondroitin ;Large breed dogs* are more prone to arthritis, thus it is important to maintain a healthy diet from the start. Provide specifically designed food so that growth takes place at an appropriate rate, since if it occurs too quickly joints might form in an abnormal manner eventually leading to joint disease. ;Certain cat breeds are also more prone to Degenerative Joint Disease, such as Himalayan, Siamese and Persian. ;Arthritis can be prevented by maintaining your pet with a healthy weight. *Golden retrievers, Rottweilers, Labrador retrievers, German shepherds"
Cat flu,"As it can be noted from the nomenclature, this is solely a feline disease. Cat flu is a viral disease and the main strains responsible are the calici, herpes and rhinotracheitis virus. These species are specific meaning that they only transfer the disease from cat to cat. The disease is transmitted through aerosol droplet from secretions (while sneezing) left in the environment. Kittens are more susceptible to the infection since their immune system is not yet completely developed and thus weak.","When a cat is seriously unwell, there is no need of a microbiological diagnosis since manifestations of cat flu symptoms are obvious. However, when unsure or when a stray cat is to be vaccinated, a swab of saliva should be taken for microbiological testing of the virus.","The disease affects the upper respiratory tract; nose, mouth, throat and eyes. ;Sore gums, tongue and eyes (in kittens sore eyes may lead to corneal ulcers) ;Purulent discharge from the eyes and nose (in kittens discharge may cause eyelids to stick together) ;Fever ;Sneezing ;Cough ;Excessive salivation ;Loss of appetite (due to the sore tongue and congestion)",;Common cold ;Viral infections,"No cure is available since it is a viral disease. ;Cat flu vaccine is available for prevention. ;Antibiotics; to prevent secondary bacterial infection, such as pneumonia, due to the weak immune response.","Since there is no cure, the cat’s immune system should fight the disease and this may take up to 2 weeks to resolve. ;It is very important to nurse and support your cat through the disease by cleaning discharge from its nose and eyes. ;Keep your cat warm, well hydrated and hand feeding may support more intake. ;There are many similarities to the symptoms of human flu, but don’t worry humans cannot get the flu. ;Following handling of an infected cat, it is important to wash hands properly and, if possible, change clothes before handling any healthy cats. ;The cat flu vaccine can be given to healthy cats so as to prevent infection and to avoid transmission of the virus to other cats."
Dental disease (Cats and Dogs),"Dental problems are very common in both dogs and cats because of the difficulty to clean their teeth. Apart from this, old age and sticky food also play a crucial role. Plaque is a colourless film which forms on the teeth and builds up over time as tartar. Since this is not removed by mechanical action like humans do, it leads to swollen, inflamed and red gums, known as gingivitis. Eventually, if this is not tackled it leads to a more serious condition known as periodontal disease, where the gums and tissue that support the teeth will be destroyed slowly and bacteria invade the gums. Stomatitis is a reaction to the plaque build up and tartar accumulation. This is more common in cats than in dogs and presents with swelling of the gum tissue, and sometimes it extends to the pharynx including the tongue.",Tartar accumulation can be visible by the naked eye as a yellow-brown film on the teeth. Swelling and redness can also be noticed which indicates either gingivitis or periodontal disease. Stomatitis is suspected when the dog or cat starts refusing food. A thorough investigation might be needed to make sure that dental problems are not due to underlying conditions such as; kidney diseases or diabetes.,";Difficulty eating ;Pain while eating ;Bad breath ;Sore mouth ;Tooth loss ;Loose teeth ;Ferocious behaviour ;Weight loss ;Yellow or brown tartar on the teeth Inflamed and red gums
;Excessive salivation
;Bleeding gums
;Rubbing the mouth
;Cats may end up with a dull and matted coat since grooming is painful",;Kidney failure ;Diabetes ;oral foreign body ;oral cancer,"Preventing dental problems is the best option, however since bacteria might be an issue, antibiotics are prescribed. ;Antibiotics such as; co-amoxiclav, doxycyline and clindamycin. Tooth extraction is another option.",";Do not worry! Dental diseases are curable. ;Support your pet through soft diets and liquids to maintain food intake. ;It is very important to schedule routine oral checkups at your veterinary and regular dental cleanings. ;Provide special pet food that helps to care for the teeth. Avoid sticky food as it sticks to the surface of the teeth and promotes the build up of plaque and tartar. ;Never use toothpaste to clean your pet’s teeth. ;Learn how to clean your pet’s teeth; Introduce the technique gradually and avoid stressing your pet. Keep session short and positive as much as possible. To start, dip your finger into beef gravy and rub against the teeth gently in a circular motion. Slowly, introduce gauze wrapped around your finger and eventually, try to introduce a soft tooth brush specially designed for pets. ;Normal dry food provides a moderate cleaning action by chewing on the kibbles."
Dermatitis (Cats and Dogs),"Skin conditions in both cats and dogs cause discomfort and irritation as a result of inflammation of the skin. There are many reasons why dermatitis can occur: ;Allergies; environmental factors such as pollen, dust and mould better known as seasonal allergies which get worse with age. Food allergies are less common than seasonal. ;Infections; bacteria can cause skin-related problems. ;Parasites; such as lice, fleas and mites can cause irritation to the skin. These can affect all type of animals; young and old, healthy and debilitated ones. ;Hormonal imbalance; both high and low.","Feline skin problems are more complicated than canine skin problems. Visual inspection doesn’t always lead to diagnosis, thus making it more difficult to determine the reason of the allergy. Seasonal allergies; scratching occurs only in 1 or 2 months out of the whole year mainly in spring and autumn. This is best to identify by undertaking skin or blood tests, but is not as reliable for cats. Food allergies; typically occur when the pet is intolerant to certain food and is itching and scratching all the time but not during certain months of the year. In this case, there is no food-allergy blood test that is reliable. In order to determine whether it is a food allergy or not it is necessary to provide a hypoallergenic or limited-ingredient diet for 2 to 3 months and then wait for the result. (This diet incorporates ingredients which the pet has never been exposed to, for example, introducing a whitefish and sweet potato diet to the dog.) If the itching does not lessen, then there is no problem with the food. Parasites; it can be very difficult to detect flea infestation on cats as during grooming most of the fleas become ingested. The only visible signs are excessive scratching and bites on your own ankle. Combing the fur of the cat using a fine-toothed comb on a sheet of white paper can make it easier to detect flea dirt present as black debris which produces a red stain when rubbed.","Licking, scratching, itching or rubbing ;Bad skin odour ;Chewing fur out ;Little black dots on the fur especially on the abdomen ;Hair loss ;Scaly or flaky patches ;Pimples, spots or red patches ;Crusts or thickened skin",N/A,"To control ticks (only dogs), fleas, lice and mosquitoes. ;Pyrethrins (natural) ;Pyrethroids; synthetic relatives of pyrethrins. Read safety label as many cannot be used in cats. Permethrin (only for dogs) Etofenprox (safe to use in cats) ;Arylheterocycles; synthetic insecticide. Fipronil ;Insect Growth Regulators; action is against the immature form and not the adult flea. Since this does not kill the adult flea, best to be combined with an adulticide. Methoprene Pyriproxyfen Fenoxycarb ;Carbamate insecticide: Methylcarbamate ;Imidacloprid (kills fleas but no activity against ticks, thus suitable for cats) ;Amitraz (use only for dogs); used as a dip to treat mange in dogs preventing the transfer from Lyme disease. ;Nitenpyram; oral flea control product. It works within 30 minutes and duration of action is 24 hours. Thus a topical application can be useful the following day. Safe to use in pregnant and nursing cats and dogs and kittens and puppies 4 weeks and older. ;Citrus extracts; Linalool d-limonene ;Synergists; used to increase the effectiveness of another ingredient in the product, for example pyrethrins. Piperonyl butoxide N-octyl bicycloheptene dicarboximide ;Sodium lauryl sulphate; natural and non-toxic flea and tick control. ;Spinosad; a derivative of a naturally occurring bacterium in the soil. To control seasonal allergies: ;Short-term or mild skin allergies; anti histamines, corticosteroids such as prednisolone, fatty acid supplements, shampoos. ;Long-term or severe skin allergies; Dogs: desensitization allergy injections (expensive treatment). Cats: antibiotics, steroids and other drugs like cyclosporine.",";Make an early check on your pet for fleas before the hot weather starts, during the warm season, even all year round in order to prevent the problem. ;As a natural remedy for fleas; Flea comb your pet twice a day, every day for months. Give a bath once weekly ;Do not use garlic or essential oils to treat external parasites. ;If you are using a pyrethroid -containing anti-flea medication, it is important to apply high on the neck and give the prescribed amount. Also, make sure to separate other cats in the same household as licking this medication may cause life threatening symptoms due to poisoning. The first signs of this are; excessive salivation, excessive twitching of the paw and vomiting. Should this occur, the pet should be taken to a veterinarian immediately. ;Avoid using sprays or dips as more effective treatment via the oral or topical route are available. ;It may be difficult to find fleas on your cats’ fur as unlike dogs cats like to eat the fleas. ;Treat all the animals in the house against fleas. If, for example, you treat your dog remember that your cat may be a reservoir of fleas. ;Treating your pet for fleas is very important as this is a very painful condition as when us humans are bitten by mosquitoes. ;Do not apply calamine lotion or bitter lemon to sooth discomfort associated with allergies and scratching."
Diabetes (Cats and Dogs),"Diabetes is a chronic disorder of carbohydrate metabolism which involves deficiency in insulin production thus a change in the blood glucose levels which can be potentially life threatening. Insulin is essential to regulate the use and storage of blood glucose thus inadequate levels in the blood circulation cause hyperglycaemia and glucosuria. This reduction in insulin levels usually occur due to damage to the pancreas. Risk factors include; ;Body condition: overweight animals have a greater predisposition ;Breed: Burmese cats and Samoyeds, miniature poodles and schnauzers and bichon frise dogs are at a higher risk ;Age: any age, however greatest over 8 years ;Gender: male cats and female dogs are more prevalent ;Stress ;Poor nutrition ;Hormonal abnormalities","Apart from the obvious signs which lead to the suspicion of diabetes, diagnostic tests are carried out to confirm the condition.",;Increased thirst ;Increased urination ;Sudden loss of weight ;Lack of energy ;Lethargy ;Vomiting ;Refusing food ;Strange and ferocious appetite ;Cataracts (in dogs) ;Abdominal pain ;Depressed,;Kidney problems ;Cancer ;Dental problems,;Insulin ;Exercise ;Proper nutrition,";Regular blood glucose monitoring is essential to adjust the dosing of the insulin according to the need. ;It is very important to keep a routine to your pet’s lifestyle. This means feeding, exercise and medication should be incorporated into a fixed daily schedule. This supports the stabilisation of blood glucose levels. ;Fibre is the golden key in managing diabetes, since fibre lower insulin requirements and blood glucose levels. ;Nutrition is very important to keep the pets’ metabolism stable. ;Keep your pet active. ;Avoid protein and carbohydrate meals, processed foods and treats, artificial colours, flavours and preservatives. ;Keep your dog on a short leash when outdoors so as to avoid the indigestion of unwanted foods and material. ;It is very important to restrict the calorie intake of your cat since diabetes is mostly associated with overweight cats."
Ear problems (Cats and Dogs),"otitis externa is the inflammation of the ear canal which may or may not involve the pinnae. It can occur either due to primary causes such as; auto-immune disease, allergy, foreign bodies, accumulation of hair and dead skin build up, parasites, etc or due to secondary causes such as medication reactions, bacteria, yeast, fungi or over cleaning. Young animals may be more predisposed to otitis externa and the most commonly affected dog breed is the cocker spaniel. otitis media is inflammation of the middle ear canal and is sometimes found together with otitis externa.","Physical examination is essential to determine the extent of pain. Redness, swelling, scaling skin or obstruction of the ear canal can all be visible. It is also important to recognise whether it is curable or chronic, since for the latter lifelong management will be required.",otitis externa ;Pain on manipulation of the ear ;Head shaking ;odour ;Exudates ;Inflammation ;Pruritus otitis media ;Vomiting ;Tilting the head ;Anorexia ;Uncoordination,N/A,";Systemic treatment is sometimes necessary since the most common cause of repeated otitis externa is undiagnosed otitis media. Antibiotics and antifungals may be prescribed. ;Topical treatment; usually consisting of antibacterial, anti yeast, corticosteroid and astringent as a combination product ;Pain and swelling managed by corticosteroids.",";If these signs are present, take your pet to a veterinarian since if left untreated it may lead to deafness. ;Ear hygiene is key in maintaining the ear healthy, however, whilst the pet is suffering from otitis externa it is important not to try and clean it yourself but to take to a veterinary surgeon. ;With the correct treatment, the otitis externa should resolve within 3 to 4 weeks, whilst for otitis media 6 weeks. ;When the ear problem resolves, you might need to clean your pet’s ear once or twice a week to prevent further attacks. This is done by using cotton balls dipped in water and wiping clean the ear lobe and the cartilage. Make sure to undertake this procedure when your pet is not going to be disturbed. ;If lifelong treatment is required, you play an important role in the management for the life of the pet. ;It is important not to discontinue treatment since the ear looks better, but to stipulate to the correct dosing schedule."
Eye Inflammation (Cats and Dogs),"Anterior uveitis, also known as the red eye syndrome, occurs when the uvea which is the part of the eye which consists of blood vessels becomes inflamed. It could threaten the animals’ vision since it also affects the iris and the surrounding pupil tissue. There are various causes including autoimmune disease, tumours, metabolic disease, trauma or injury and infections.","Eye inflammation is very easy to recognise, however, other diagnostic tests may be undertaken to eliminate any other possible causes such as; high blood pressure in the eye known as glaucoma or even cataracts.",;Discharge ;Pain ;Redness ;Excessive tears ;Swelling of the eyeball ;Pupil has an uneven shape or is small ;Front of the eye is cloudy or dull ;Change in the colour of the iris,;Topical treatment such as; drops or ointments in combination products. ;Systemic treatment is sometimes necessary for pain and inflammation.,";Take care to ensure that the living environment is well kept to avoid contracting a rare eye disease. ;Take time everyday to inspect your pets’ eye for any changes. ;It is very challenging to instil the drops or ointment in your dog’s or cat’s eye, however do not give up since the sake of going blind is in your hands.",
Gastrointestinal and Digestive disorders (Cats and Dogs),"A gastrointestinal disorder or disease - when the pet is suffering from a stomach, intestinal or any other related problem. A digestive disorder -when the passage of food through the digestive tract is altered or there is a reduction in absorption or digestion. A normal digestive process is paramount in a pet as essential nutrients and minerals are absorbed from the food that a dog or cat is fed. These are required primarily for energy and to support the repair and growth of body tissues. Any change in the gastrointestinal system can result in; malnutrition, electrolyte imbalance, dehydration and changes in acid base concentrations of the blood. Different types of Gastrointestinal and digestive disorders: ;Acute gastroenteritis; inflammation or infection or both of the stomach and intestines. This can be caused by eating high fat people food, rancid food, foreign objects or toxic plants. It can also be due to stress, food allergies or internal parasites. ;Colitis; inflammation of the colon which manifests as pain upon defecating. It is most frequently associated with tumours, change in food, swallowed foreign objects or allergies. ;Diarrhoea; results from infection, internal parasites, stress, rancid food or a change in diet. ;Constipation; mainly due to dehydration, increasing age, indigestion of hair or other foreign material and can also be due to tumours. ;Small intestinal malabsorption",Digestive disorders can be easily recognised by the simplest signs of diarrhoea and vomiting.,;Vomiting ;Regurgitation ;Diarrhoea ;Constipation (food moves through GI tract at a slow rate) ;Flatulence ;Change in appetite ;Blood in faeces ;Weight loss ;Abdominal pain ;Weakness ;Dehydration,;Cancer ;Ageing,Treatment varies according to the condition. The following are some medicines that may be used; ;Intravenous or subcutaneous fluids in extreme cases of dehydration ;Antibiotics in the presence of an infection ;oral steroids such as prednisolone in the event of inflammation,;Severe diarrhoea or vomiting may lead to dehydration. It is important to consult your veterinarian immediately. ;offer your pet lots of fresh water to maintain hydration. ;Change in diet is crucial to decrease digestive tract problems. Choose food which is high in soluble and insoluble fibre to be easily digestible. ;Never feed your pet scrapes of skin or other left over’s which are not good for you. If they are not good for your neither are for your pet.
Heart disease (Cats and Dogs),"The common heart disease mostly seen in cats is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy which affects the heart muscle. The walls of the heart thicken and eventually the heart is unable to pump out the blood efficiently throughout the body. Also the heart doesn’t fill up with a sufficient amount of blood. Eventually, this can lead to congestive heart failure with a build up of fluid in the abdomen and chest. Blood clot formation is another complication of heart disease. With increasing age and weight, there is a higher risk of developing a heart disease.","If suspected, medical tests should be carried out such as; echocardiogram, blood pressure measurement, blood and urine tests, x-rays and stethoscope exam.",;Lethargy ;Tiredness ;Reduced ability to exercise ;Swelling of the abdomen ;Difficulty breathing ;Fainting ;Weakness ;Coughing ;Increased heart and breath rate ;Sudden death,;Cancer ;Weight problems,"There is no cure, however the control of symptoms is paramount to increase the years. ;Diuretics; furosemide ;Angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors; benazepril, pimobendan",";Treatment will not reverse your pets’ heart disease. ;It is very important to feed your pet a healthy diet, low in sodium so that it will help to reduce the fluid build up and support the heart to work effectively. ;Exercise should not be vigorous but light. ;Weight management should be carried out more often. ;Support your pet through giving the medication daily and at the appropriate time and not how it suits you."

Kidney disease (Cats and Dogs),"The kidneys are responsible to remove waste substances from the blood and maintain a healthy fluid balance within the body. They are also known as life sustaining organs, meaning if the kidneys are not functioning well, life-threatening situations may arise. Kidney disease can be either acute or chronic. Acute kidney disease can be a result of; certain drugs, poisons, trauma, surgical stress, infection, obstructed urine flow, shock, blood loss and severe dehydration. Chronic kidney disease is irreversible and progressive. The same factors as for acute disease play a role however hereditary and breed tendencies, immune system defects and nutritional factors are responsible.","Some may show early signs of kidney disease; however, serious illness signs usually appear after 75% of the kidney function is lost. It is very important to detect it as early as possible by undertaking blood and urine tests. one crucial sign that suggests kidney problems is increased thirst, and therefore action should be taken immediately.",;Increased thirst ;Dehydration ;Lethargy ;Weakness ;Confusion ;Increased urine output ;Poor coat appearance ;Sore mouth ;Depression ;Bad breath ;Weight loss ;Less appetite ;Increased sleeping,;Heart disease ;Diabetes ;Hyperthyroidism ;Urinary tract disease ;Cancer,";Euthanasia ;Kidney transplant (very expensive) ;Intravenous or subcutaneous fluids ;Bicarbonate: to neutralise, either given orally or intravenously ;Antibiotics: if infection is present ;Phosphate binders ;omega fatty acids",";Support your dog or cat through this chronic condition. Be patient and caring. ;Dry food and water only can be problematic, since this does not provide the amount of water that canned food would. ;For cats, adding wet food and cat milk provide a good source of water, therefore preventing kidney and bladder problems. ;Low protein, salt and phosphorous food is important to prevent further deterioration of renal function whilst maintaining a positive quality of life."
Leishmaniasis (Cats and Dogs ),"Leishmaniasis most commonly known as sand fly can be a deadly disease in dogs if not diagnosed early. This can also affect cats, however it is more common to affect dogs. It is caused by a bite usually in the muzzle or the ear by a tiny, sand coloured mosquito. The mosquito carries the protozoa Leishmania infantum and can bite the dog up to 100 times in an hour. This single cell organism travels to the dog’s cells and invades the blood stream affecting the internal organs and eventually end up harming the immune system.","Blood serum antibody tests need to be done to detect leishmaniasis. It is best to carry out the test in winter time and also yearly to exclude any possibility, and if present it will be detected as early as possible.",;Tiny skin lesion in the muzzle or ear ;Severe weight loss ;Loss of appetite ;Diarrhoea ;Vomiting ;Nose bleeds ;Exercise intolerance ;Alopecia ;Hyperkeratosis,;Dermatitis,;Allopurinol; a human medicine usually used for gout,";Collars containing deltamethrin ;Vaccine; can only be used in leishamania negative dogs ;Essential oils; such as neem, citronella, eucalyptus, lemon eucalyptus, lavender and tea tree. Very important: NEVER apply essential oils undiluted! It is best to dilute 1 part of the essential oil with 9 parts water, store in a spray bottle and always shake before use. ;The medication may cause urinary stones on long treatment. ;Proper nutrition is crucial to boost your dogs’ immune system. ;Liver and kidney supplements are necessary to strengthen them due to the regular use of the medicine. ;Although the name implies sand, these are not found on sandy beaches but are found around rubble walls and old houses. ;The fly is sensitive to the sun thus it is active from dusk till dawn. To prevent bites it is best to avoid prolonged stays outdoors. ;Apply a natural insect repellent. ;Hairless spots are the areas where the flies bite. ;Don’t worry, if your dog is moving it is difficult to be a target, however if it sleeps outside there is a higher risk of contracting this disease. ;In Malta, sand fly season commences in the beginning of May and stops end of September. ;Be careful, this is a zoonotic disease and the organisms living in the lesions can be contracted by humans!!"
Foot and mouth disease,"The foot-and-mouth disease is a highly communicable disease affecting cloven footed animals. It is characterized by fever, formation of vesicles and blisters in the mouth, udder, teats and on the skin between the toes and above the hoofs. In India, the disease is widespread and assumes a position of importance in livestock industry. The disease spreads by direct contact or indirectly through infected water, manure, hay and pastures. It is also conveyed by cattle attendants. It is known to spread through recovered animals, field rats, porcupines and birds.",,"• fever with 104-105o F • profuse salivation - ropes of stringy saliva hangs from mouth • vesicles appear in mouth and in the inter digital space • lameness observed • cross bred cattle are highly susceptible to it Fever, loss of feed intake, drop in milk production, drooling of saliva like ropey string, vesicles develop on the tongue, lips, gums, and palate and eventually rupture.

Urinary tract disease (Cats and Dogs),"The most common feline urinary tract disorder is feline interstitial cystitis. It is caused by an inflammation of an unknown cause; however stress can be one of the factors. Urinary crystals or stones are a complication for both dogs and cats. This cause irritation, pain and blockage and is a very uncomfortable experience for the animal. Urinary bladder stones form from mineral crystals that come together as one. Risk factors for urinary tract diseases include the following: ;Age: cats more than 1 year old and dogs between 2 and 8 years are at higher risk ;Gender: both genders carry an equal risk however males are more predisposed to life threatening urethral obstruction from stones. ;overweight cats ;Lack of exercise ;Low water intake ;Nutrition: too much calcium, magnesium, phosphorous and protein",N/A,;Urinating outside of the litter box ;Loss of bladder control leading to incontinence ;Straining when urinating ;Licking the genital area ;Reduced appetite ;Blood in urine ;Lack of energy or interest in daily activities ;Frequent attempts to urinate ;Decreased urine flow ;Crying out in pain,;Kidney disease,";Surgery, especially males ;Antibiotics; however not all cases have infections ;Anti-anxieties; for stress. Might take a while to work, however not recommended. Stress relief can be done in other ways. ;Glucosamine; to strengthen the bladder lining.",";Episodes usually subside with or without treatment and last only for a few days. ;Cats sometimes associate painful urination with the litter box and end up not using it. ;Stress for cats can occur because there are other guests at the house, conflicts with other pets and also lack of places to hide or rest. It is important to make changes to decrease stress in the environment. ;Be careful when choosing the right food for your pet and make sure that it does not contain high amounts of phosphorous, calcium or magnesium. ;Make sure to increase water consumption by providing fresh and clean water. ;Moist or canned food also helps to increase water consumption. ;Small meals several times a day are much better than one or two large meals a day. ;Any dog or cat which have been treated for urinary tract disease will be at risk of contracting it again, thus it is paramount to make sure to observe your pet to detect the signs early."
Rabies (Mad dog disease),"Rabies is a disease of dogs, foxes, wolves, hyaenas and in some places, it is a disease of bats which feed on blood. The disease is passed to other animals or to people if they are bitten by an animal with rabies. The germs which cause rabies live in the saliva of the sick (rabid) animal. This is a killer disease but not every dog which bites is infected with rabies. When the rabid animal bites another animal or human, the germs which live in its saliva pass into the body through the wound caused by the bite. The germs travel along the nerves to the brain. The time between the bite and the first appearance of signs that the bitten animal or human has been infected can take from 2 to 10 weeks or more. The time taken depends on the distance of the bite from the brain. If the bite is on the face or head, the bitten animal or human will quickly show signs, but if the bite is on the leg it will take much longer for signs to develop.",,"You should first look for the marks of the bite and discover where and when the animal was bitten. All rabid animals show similar signs in the beginning. • they change their normal behaviour and behave very strangely. • They stop eating or drinking. • Male animal will try to mate (mount) other animals. • there is no change in the body temperature. • These signs will continue for 3 to 5 days. Then, before it dies, the animal will develop one or the other of two types of the disease: o the furious (mad) type of the disease makes the animal aggressive and it will bite anything. o The quiet (dumb) type when the animal is quiet and does not move.","Rabies in the dog Dogs show either of the two types of rabies. • a dog with the dumb or quiet type of the disease cannot move. It looks as if it has a bone stuck in the mouth and saliva drips from the mouth. • rabies in the dog lasts about 10 days before the animal dies. If the animal does not die after this length of time then it may not be suffering from rabies. Rabies in sheep, goats and cattle Rabies is characterised by the animals becoming restless and excited. They may bite themselves and saliva drips from the mouth. The most important sign in cattle is that the animal bellows (calls) very frequently and with strange sound. The animals will become paralysed and die. Rabies in the horse and camel The horse will show the furious (mad) type of the disease. It will kick and bite and show signs similar to colic. The animal will die after paralysis of the back legs. In the camel the signs of rabies are similar to those shown by an animal in the rut. What to do with a biting dog Remember that not every dog which bites has rabies. If the dog belongs to somebody ask the owner about its normal behaviour. If the dog is showing signs of rabies you must inform your veterinary officer immediately. The dog must be shot and if it has bitten anybody, they must be taken to a hospital immediately for vaccination.",,"Dogs in your community can be vaccinated against rabies. You should ask your veterinary service about vaccination against rabies. If there is an outbreak of rabies, the livestock in your community can be vaccinated too."
Weight Management (Cats and Digs),"Excessive weight is not good for anyone even for animals. This can be the cause of serious health problems such as; arthritis, respiratory and heart disease and cancer. Too much eating especially together with lack of exercise is the perfect combination for weight gain due to the increase in body fat which is not being burnt by exercise. However, there are other contributing factors; ;Age: older age results in being less active and thus more prone to weight gain ;Spaying and Neutering: promotes a slower metabolism ;Gender: female cats more at risk ;Feeding habits ;overfeeding ;overeating ;Medical disorders ;Breeds: mixed breeds for cats and cocker and Cavalier King Charles spaniel and Labrador retrievers for dogs","Some are very obvious to recognise, whilst some may not be that easy.

Many pet foods are full of fats and salts to make the taste better and may result in over eating. ;It is important to feed your pet low-fat and low-calorie food to promote weight loss. ;Although for you, your pet doesn’t seem overweight, it is crucial to monitor the weight at your veterinarian to make sure to maintain a healthy life. ;To promote exercise and weight loss: o For dogs: walk your dog at a steady pace, enjoy playing time and try to play a retrieval game such as tossing a Frisbee. o For cats: call your cat to follow you, enjoy playing time by using a flash light and shining it on the walls so that your cat can chase it while exercising at the same time."
Coccidiosis (Rabbit),"Coccidiosis is a parasitic disease which affects rabbits worldwide. There are 2 forms; hepatic and intestinal, the latter being the most dangerous and deadly. Transmission is carried out by the faecal-oral route for both, however, although good hygienic measures are carried out to eliminate coccidiosis, the intestinal form can still be present even in hygienic environments.",This is carried out by microscopic detection of oocytes in the faeces.,;Anorexia ;Rough coat ;Intestinal lesions ;Hepatic lesions ;Diarrhoea ;Loss of appetite ;Weakness ;Lethargy ;Dehydration,N/A,";Sulpha-drugs; Sulfaquinoxaline, sulphadimethoxime, sulphadimerazine ;other coccidostats; amprolium, salinomycin, diclazuril, toltrazuril",";If treatment is successful, your rabbit is immune to the infection. ;Some rabbits may be carrying the disease without knowing, so be careful when your rabbit is in contact with new rabbits. ;It is very important to remove faeces frequently as to prevent the contamination of food and water with faeces. ;If your rabbit is kept in a wired cage even just to sleep overnight, the cage should be brushed daily. ;Using ammonia solution 10 % to sanitise the living areas is the best, since it kills the oocytes produced in the faeces."
Blue Tongue,"Bluetongue, a disease which is transmitted by midges, infects domestic and wild ruminants and also camelids, however sheep are particularly badly affected. Cattle, although infected more frequently than sheep, do not always show signs of disease. Virus spreads between animals occurs via the midges of Cullicoides species. The likelihood of mechanical transmission between herds and flocks, or indeed within a herd or flock, by unhygienic practices (the use of contaminated surgical equipment or hypodermic needles) may be a possibility. Sheep are more
susceptible than
goats.",,"Sheep : eye and nasal discharges, drooling, high body temperature, swelling in mouth, head and neck, lameness and wasting of muscles in hind legs, haemorrages into or under skin, inflammation of the coronary band, respiratory problems, fever, lethargy. In cattle : nasal discharge, swelling of head and neck, conjunctivitis, swelling inside and ulceration of the mouth, swollen teats, tiredness, saliva drooling, fever. Note: a blue tongue is rarely a clinical sign of infection Control : Inspect stock closely, particularly focusing on the lining of the mouth and nose and the coronary band (where the hoof stops and the skin starts). If an animal is suspected as having bluetongue, it must be reported as quickly as possible. Telephone your local animal health office immediately. Fever, swelling of face,

Restriction in animal movement, segregation of affected animals and symptomatic treatment. Strict biosecurity measures.",
Dental disease (Rabbit),"The teeth are really important for a rabbit. Without the front teeth known as the incisors, the rabbit cannot strip, cut and snip. The tongue is used to push the collected food back to the grinding teeth where these break the harsh fibre down into small pieces that can be swallowed. Chewing all day is a lot of work on the teeth and eventually teeth wears down. However to allow chewing all day, the teeth grow faster than normal teeth would, therefore if the rabbit eats a low fibre diet the teeth won’t wear down at a fast rate and result in overgrown teeth.","The teeth grow both ways, up and down, so some signs may be strange to be associated with overgrown teeth. This is something really painful for the rabbit, so it is crucial to recognize the signs to take action.",;Wet chin due to excessive salivation ;Teeth grinding ;Creamy white eye discharge ;Runny nose ;Refuse food ;Matted fur ;Caecotrophs stuck to his bottom ( caecotrophs are the pellets produced by the rabbit to re-eat) ;Facial abscess ;Weight loss ;Tongue or buccal lesions,;Pasteurellosis ;Myxomatosis,;Teeth trimming; using scissor clipper or burring.

Listeriosis,"Listeriosis is a bacterial infection most commonly caused by Listeria monocytogenes,[1] although L. ivanovii and L. grayi have been reported in certain cases. Listeriosis can cause severe illness, including severe sepsis, meningitis, or encephalitis, sometimes resulting in lifelong harm and even death",,"In farm animals the disease occurs towards the end of winter or early spring. The first signs of meningo- encephalitis are stiffness of neck, incoordinated movement of limbs and tendency to move in circles or to lean against a fence or wall. There may be paralysis of muscles of jaw and pharynx. Incoordination becomes progressively more severe until the animal can no longer stand. The cattle which are not severely affected may survive. Abortions in cattle usually occur after 4-8 months of pregnancy and at a comparatively later stage in sheep. In pigs and horses, clinical signs are not common but may develop as encephalitis and septicaemia. In poultry, the disease usually causes sudden death, occasionally there are signs of torticollis, weakness and inco-ordination of the legs.",,,
Heat Stroke (Rabbit),"Heatstroke occurs when a rabbit gets too hot and is unable to regulate their body temperature. Heatstroke is a serious illness for rabbits and can prove fatal. A rabbit’s enclosure should ideally be between 10-20 degrees celsius. In the wild, the temperature of their underground warrens stays at around 10 degrees celsius between winter and summer. However, there’s a fine line as rabbits can start to show signs of heatstroke at 25 degrees celsius.

Mastitis,"Mastitis, or inflammation of the mammary gland, is the most common and the most expensive disease of dairy cattle throughout most of the world. Although stress and physical injuries may cause inflammation of the gland, infection by invading bacteria or other microorganisms (fungi, yeasts and possibly viruses) is the primary cause of mastitis. Infections begin when microorganisms penetrate the teat canal and multiply in the mammary gland.",,,,"• success depends on the nature of the aetiological agent involved, the severity of the disease and the extent of fibrosis. • complete recovery with freedom from bacterial infection can be obtained in cases of recent infection and in those where fibrosis has taken place only to a small extent. • such drugs as acriflavine, gramicidin and tyrothricin have now ceased to be in use, and have given place to the more effective drugs, such as sulphonamides, penicillin and streptomycin.",
Footrot,"Foot rot is a common cause of lameness in cattle and occurs most frequently when cattle on pasture are forced to walk through mud to obtain water and feed. However, it may occur among cattle in paddocks as well, under apparently excellent conditions. Foot rot is caused when a cut or scratch in the skin allows infection to penetrate between the claws or around the top of the hoof. Individual cases should be kept in a dry place and treated promptly with medication as directed by a veterinarian. If the disease becomes a herd problem a foot bath containing a 5% solution of copper sulphate placed where cattle are forced to walk though it once or twice a day will help to reduce the number of new infections. In addition, drain mud holes and cement areas around the water troughs where cattle are likely to pick up the infection. Keep pens and areas where cattle gather as clean as possible. Proper nutrition regarding protein, minerals and vitamins will maximize hoof health.",,,,,
Bovine rhinotracheitis,"Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) is a highly contagious, infectious respiratory disease that is caused by bovine herpesvirus-1 (bhv-1). It can affect young and older cattle. In addition to causing respiratory disease, this virus can cause conjunctivitis, abortions, encephalitis, and generalised systemic infections. Ibr is characterized by acute inflammation of the upper respiratory tract.",,,,There is no direct treatment for viral diseases. Infected animals should be isolated from the rest of the herd and treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics for secondary infections if necessary. Carrier cattle should be identified and removed from the herd.,Control of the disease is based on the use of vaccines.
Mites (Rabbit),"Ear mites infestation is caused by parasites which affect either one ear, both and also surrounding areas such as the neck, head, genital region and the abdomen. The mites create what is known as an ear canker because they irritate the ear and form brown crusts. If untreated it may penetrate the inner ear, cause damage to the brain and can result in totricollis (torsion of the neck).","It might not be easy to recognise, however, skin scales might be very visible on the inner ear, which turn into larger and thicker crusted lesions and can also be accompanied by hair loss. Mites might not be visible to the naked eye but your veterinarian will determine the cause.",";Itching around the ear, neck and head ;Head shaking ;Head scratching ;Hair loss or peeling ;Brown crusty exudates in the ears ;Affected areas may become extremely painful ;Pyrexia ;Lethargy ;Loss of balance",;Ear infections,";Antiparasitic drugs: ivermectin, selamectin ;Topical antibiotics ;oral antibiotics",";The mite is contagious, thus it is imperative to isolate the affected rabbit and treat all rabbits in the household. Clean thoroughly the living area and discard of all organic material in the cage. ;The cage should be cleaned everyday during the treatment period and nothing should be reused. ;Any combs and brushes should be discarded to prevent re-infection. ;Do not attempt to remove the crusts from the skin. ;Important to attend for a follow up 1 month after the treatment commences. Fur mites are not as problematic as ear mites, but are very common and can be easily transmitted by direct contact. Whilst ear mites cause extreme itching, fur mites do not. Dandruff may be noticed coming off your rabbit which can be detected upon placing against a dark background. Insecticides, such as imidacloprid, can be applied to prevent infestations."
Piglet diarrhea or scour,"of all the diseases in the sucking piglet, diarrhea is the most common and probably the most important. In some outbreaks, it is responsible for high morbidity and mortality. The main bacterial causes are E. Coli and Clostridia and the main parasite is Coccidia.",,"Scour in the piglet can occur at any age during sucking but there are often two peak periods, before 5 days and between 7 and 14 days.",,,"• adopt procedures to prevent the spread of the scour - disinfect boots between pens, use a disposable plastic apron when dosing piglets to prevent heavy contamination of clothing, wash hands after handling a scoured litter, disinfect brushes and shovels between pen. • ensure that farrowing houses are only used on an all-in all-out basis with a pressure wash and disinfection between each batch. • farrowing pens must be dry before the house is repopulated. Remember that moisture, warmth, waste food and faeces are ideal for bacterial multiplication. • pen floors should be well maintained. Poor pen hygiene associated with bad drainage predisposes to scour. • look carefully at the part of the pen floor where there are piglet faeces. Is this poorly drained? Do large wet patches develop? If so cover them with extra bedding daily and remove. This is a most important aspect of control. • check nipple drinkers and feeding troughs for leakages. • ensure that faeces are removed daily from behind the sow from the day she enters the farrowing crates until at least 7 days post-farrowing if the floors are slatted. Also remove faeces daily throughout lactation if they are solid concrete. • maintain creep environments that are always warm and comfortable. Fluctuating temperatures are a major trigger factor to scour particularly from 7 to 14 days of age. • assess the environment of all the farrowing house. Poor environments allow heavy bacterial multiplication and a much higher bacterial challenge is likely to break down the colostral immunity. • check the sow's health. Animals affected with enteric or respiratory disease, lameness or mastitis predispose the litter to scour. • where farrowing house floors are very poor, pitted and difficult to clean, brush them over with lime wash containing a phenolic disinfectant. • Colostrum management : it is vital that the piglet receives the maximum amount of colostrum within the first 12 hours of birth. High levels of antibody are only absorbed during this period. Factors such as poor teat access, poor crate design, and particularly the development of agalactia in the sow, associated with udder oedema, reduce intake."
Myxomatosis (Rabbit),"This fatal disease is caused by a myxoma virus and can occur in all domesticated rabbit breeds. Some rabbits are resistant, such as the cottontail and jackrabbits. Transmission can occur via direct contact and through bites from mosquitoes, flies and fleas.",Eye inflammation with milky discharge is the initial symptom.,";Eye inflammation ;Milky eye discharge ;Anorexia ;Weakness ;Lethargy ;Pyrexia ;Death within 48 hours ;Purulent nasal discharge ;Rough coat ;Depression ;Swollen eyelids, ears, nose and lips ;Swelling of the genital area ;Coma",;Dental problems ;Eye infections ;Pasteurellosis,"There is no cure to viral infections. ;Fluids ;Antibiotics; to prevent secondary infections Euthanasia is sometimes recommended, to prevent the long and painful death.",";To prevent your rabbit from contracting this disease, protect against mosquitoes and biting flies. This can be done in several ways; o Surround the living area (even if indoors) with mosquito netting o Avoid outsides in the early mornings and late afternoons o Use flea prevention products such as imidacloprid o Vaccination (if available) ;It is very difficult to accept that the best option for your pet is euthanasia, however, this is a fatal disease and otherwise your rabbit will pass through an agonising death. ;It is very important to disinfect all the equipment used by the infected rabbit. ;Wait 4 months before bringing a new rabbit to ensure complete eradication of the virus."
Pasteurellosis (Rabbit),"This condition is also known as snuffles because of the characteristic snuffling breathing sound. Some rabbits do not show symptoms of infection, because these microorganisms reside in the nasal cavity and upper respiratory system and are kept in equilibrium by the rabbit’s immune system. If the bacteria become active, infection can spread to the sinuses and bones of the face and on long exposure to the eyes, ears and blood. This is a highly contagious disease, and can be transmitted both by direct contact and aerosol.","The characteristic breathing sound and exudates coming out the nose and eyes are the main factor to recognise this condition; however, since the signs are so widespread a nasal swab will usually be taken for testing. Sometimes a complete blood count and urinalysis are also undertaken.",;Strange behaviour ;Staining of the front paws ( with discharge collected whilst grooming) ;Anorexia ;Depression ;Head shaking ;Torticollis ;Excessive tears ;Blockage of the tear ducts ;Shortness of breath ;Scratching of the ears ;Genital infections; thick whitish greyish discharge,;Dental disease ;Ear infection ;Eye infection ;Cold ;Sinusitis,;Antibiotics; enrofloxacin ;Surgery,";Infection can spread through the air and is highly contagious especially for rabbits at birth.

Help by cleaning the nostrils, keeping him warm and provide the right nutrition. ;It is imperative to encourage oral fluids either as fresh water or also as leafy vegetables and moistened greens such as parsley, carrots, cilantro etc. ;Do not give high carbohydrate or high fat food. ;If your rabbit is not eating, you have to feed using a syringe appropriate gruel mixture."
Red Eye Syndrome (Rabbit),This is one of the most common eye problems seen in rabbits. Red eye is a result of many different causes; ;Bacterial infections ;Glaucoma: can lead to blindness if untreated ;Corneal ulceration: mainly due to trauma ;Conjunctivitis: inflammation of the lining of the eye ;Keratitis ;Dental disease,"The underlying cause determines different signs, and usually it is a very difficult task to come to the exact cause. However, if your rabbit has a red eye, which can be recognised by swollen and irritated eyes, take immediately to a veterinarian.",;Eye discharge ;Swollen eye ;Impaired vision ;Extra tissue around the eye ;Nasal discharge ;Cold ;Lethargy ;Crusting ;Hair loss around the eyes and nasal area ;Abnormal posture,;Dental disease ;Myxomatosis ;Pasteurellosis,;Topical antibiotics ;Topical atropine ;Topical steroids,";Check you rabbit’s teeth. ;Take particular caution when caring for young rabbits since they are more susceptible to eye disease. ;Minimise source of irritation such as dust and dirt by daily cleaning. ;At first, you can use any commercial eye washing product to remove any debris and dirt form the eye of your rabbit. ;Repeated eye checks may be necessary to monitor outcomes of therapy and especially to prevent blindness."
Trichobezoars (Rabbit),"Rabbits groom themselves continuously, so hair is often found in the stomach but this doesn’t normally cause symptoms. Usually, it is passed with other stomach contents and excreted as faecal pellets. Hair chewing can be due to different reasons, one of them is having a low fibre diet and the other strangely enough is boredom. Rabbits are not capable of vomiting the hair balls like cats, and unfortunately it must be able to pass through the digestive system.","It is very difficult to recognise this condition, so it is best to avoid by practising effective preventative measures. An abnormally distended abdomen might be visible and it calls for an emergency veterinary appointment.",;Weight loss ;Anorexia ;Death within 3 to 4 weeks ;Gastric ulceration ;Decreased food intake ;Abdominal distension ;Pain ;Dehydration ;Diarrhoea ;Weakness ;Teeth grinding,;Pasteurellosis,;Add magnesium oxide to the diet ;Motility stimulants; such as metoclopramide ;Fluid therapy ;Pain medication ;Antiulcer therapy ;Probiotics,";To stop boredom, provide an environment where the rabbit can play and keep himself busy. ;To treat an early case, pineapple juice can be given since it contains bromelain, which is a digestive enzyme and helps to break up the hairball. Canned pineapple juice is not effective since the enzyme is destroyed with the process of canning. ;The best option is to prevent by providing your rabbit with a high fibre diet. ;Daily combing helps to remove any loose hair. ;Avoid stressing the rabbit by changing the environment for no reason."
PPR (goat plague),PPR (Peste des petits ruminants) is a most important viral disease of goat capable of heavy mortality and commonly called as goat plague.,,"The clinical sign of PPR in goats is often fulminating and fatal although apparent infection occurs in endemic areas. Incubation period may range from 2-6 days in field conditions. In acute form, there is sudden onset of fever with rectal temperature of at least 40°- 41°C. The affected goats show dullness, sneezing, serous discharge from the eyes and nostrils. During this stage farmers often think that the animal has developed cold exposure and may attempt to provide protection for cold. In the process goats, may be congregated and accentuate the process of transmission. After 2-3 days, discrete lesions develop in the mouth and extend over the entire oral mucosa, forming diphtheric plaques. During this stage profound halitosis (foul smell) is easily appreciable and the animal is unable to eat due to sore mouth and swollen lips. Latter ocular discharge becomes mucopurulent and the exudate dries up, matting the eyelids and partially occluding the nostrils. Diarrhea develops 3-4 days after the fever and is profuse and faeces may be mucoid or bloody depending upon the damage. Dyspnea and coughing occur later due to secondary pneumonia. Death occurs within one week of the onset of the illness.",,"No specific treatment is recommended for PPR being viral disease. However, mortality rates can be reduced by the use of drugs that control the bacterial and parasitic complications. Lesions around the eyes, nostrils and mouth should be cleaned twice daily with sterile cotton swab. Immediate isolation of affected goats from clinically healthy goats is most importance measure in controlling the spread of infection. Nutritious soft, moist, palatable diet should be given to the affected goats. Provide parenteral energy infusion in anorectic goats along with appetizers. Immediately measures should be taken for notification of disease to nearest government veterinary hospital.",
Ulcerative Pododermatitis (Rabbit),"Ulcerative pododermatitis is commonly referred to as sore hocks where the footpad appears to be crusted, swollen and even bleeding. This can even spread to a bone infection known as osteomyelitis and lead to death. Sore hocks can result from excessive weight due to pressure of the skin on wired floor cages or from trauma. other factors can play a role in predisposing the rabbit such as, nervousness, genetics, heavy breed, urine soaked faeces, type of wire used and posterior paralysis after a spinal cord injury.","It is very easy to recognise from the following signs. However, early detection is crucial to prevent infection moving from the wounds to the bones.",;Swollen foot pad ;Crusts ;Bleeding ;Lethargy ;Bone infection ;Tiptoe walking,;osteomyelitis,;Debriding agents; to clean the lesions ;Topical antibiotics ;Leg amputation,";Condition may recur. ;First use debriding agents to clean the lesions and afterwards apply the topical antibiotics. ;Help your pet to lose weight, by feeding more grass and hay rather than pellets. ;Play with your rabbit to help exercising and moving. ;Remove soiled bedding to ensure the area is kept dry. Make sure to provide non-abrasive and soft bedding. ;Daily checking of the feet can prevent this problem."
Bovine babesiosis (tick fever),"Bovine babesiosis, also known as ""Red Water"", is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Babesia. It's found in areas where ticks are common, and is transmitted when ticks feed on infected cattle. Ticks can then pass the parasite on to the larvae they produce. Cattle. Cross
breeds are more
susceptible.",,"• high fever • neurologic signs such as incoordination, teeth grinding and mania. Some cattle may be found on the ground with the involuntary movements of the legs. When the nervous symptoms of cerebral babesiosis develop, the outcome is almost always fatal. • dark colored urine • anorexia • animals likely to separate from herd, be weak, depressed and reluctant to move • n b. Bigemina parasitaemia often exceeds 10 per cent and may be as high as 30 per cent. Subacute infections, with less apparent clinical signs, are also seen. High temperature,
jaundice like symptoms,
yellowish mucosal
membrane of eye, rectum
and coffee colour urine",,,"Effective control of tick fevers has been achieved by a combination of measures directed at both the disease and the tick vector. Tick control by acaracide dipping is widely used in endemic areas. Dipping may be done as frequently as every 4-6 weeks in heavily infested areas. The occurrence of resistance of ticks, chemical residues in cattle and environmental concerns over the continued use of insecticides has led to use of integrated strategies for tick control. Babesiosis vaccines are readily available and are highly effective. Anti-tick vaccines are also available in some countries and can be used as part of an integrated program for the control of ticks. Babesiosis can be eradicated by eliminating the host tick(s). In the us, this was accomplished by treating all cattle every two to three weeks with acaricides. In countries where eradication is not feasible, tick control can reduce the incidence of disease. Periodical application of
acaricides in and around the
animal shed and on the
animals. For therapeutic
application, Diaminazine or
Imidocarb can be useful."
Coccidiosis (Pigeons),This is a very common intestinal disease amongst pigeons worldwide due to the protozoa Coccidia which reside in the small intestine of nearly all pigeons. It forms long lasting oocytes and following incubation these become infective.,"Coccidia oocytes are first ingested by the pigeon and development takes place in the intestine within 4 to 7 days in different stages, resulting in damage to the intestinal wall. As a result, the pigeon starts to excrete oocytes again. Two forms of coccidiosis: 1. Asymptomatic form : occurs most frequently. Birds develop resistance/ immunity with the help of the internal defence mechanisms to the first small quantities of oocytes ingested. This immunity is strengthened constantly by the ingestion of small amounts of oocytes in turn protecting against the severe form. 2. Acute/ Visible form : occurs at extremes of age; Young pigeons still without resistance to the oocytes or older pigeons whose immunity is lowered by stress factors.","Asymptomatic form: ;Appear healthy but less lively ;Droppings sometimes soft (small amounts of oocytes present in faeces) Acute form: ;Noticeably affected ;Noxious, watery-like, greenish and sometimes bloody diarrhoea (large amounts if oocytes present in faeces) ;Puffed up feathers General condition impaired: reduced feed and increase water intake resulting in general malaise and malnutrition.",;E.coli infection ;Salmonellosis ;Worm infestation,"Asymptomatic form: Do not treat, although they show mild symptoms of infestation so as not to disturb the resistance being developed. Acute form: ;Antiprotozoal agent; amprolium which is a coccidiostat",;Development of feathers will not be disrupted. ;Support treatment by the administration of vitamins particularly A and K3 and supplements of amino acids. ;Use best possible diet.
E.Coli infection (Pigeons),Escherichia coli infection is the second most common disease of the digestive tract following salmonellosis. E.coli bacteria are present as part of the normal flora of the gut of both warm blooded animals and humans. These can also survive for many months in faeces provided that there is an adequate environment. An E.coli bacterium is re-introduced into the body with contaminated feed or water or via inhalation through dust particles.,Rapid multiplication of the E.Coli bacteria results in inflammation of the intestine with consequent diarrhoea in turn leading to loss of water and electrolytes. Bacteria can also penetrate into the bloodstream affecting individual organs resulting in a systemic infection which after only a few hour or days leads to death.,Typical signs of a systemic disorder; ;General condition impaired: reduced feed and increase water intake resulting in general malaise and malnutrition ;Ruffled feathers ;Pain signs; drawn up back and lowered tail ;Respiratory tract may also be involved,;Coccidiosis ;Salmonellosis ;Hexamitiasis,;Nitrofuran antibacterial agents; furazolidone ;Chloramphenicol ;Penicillin antibiotic agents; ampicillin,";Pigeons which are affected with the infection should be selected and separated from the entire flock as these can shed the pathogens. ;Remove factors within the loft which lower the resistance to pathogens: ventilation and waste-air extraction, deficient supply of oxygen, presence of noxious gases, dust in the loft, stocking density. ;Do not leave any feed overnight due to the risk of contamination by insects, mice or rats. Apart from this precaution, feed and water bowls are to be cleaned thoroughly and make sure that no rodents can access the loft."
Endoparasites; Worm infestation (Pigeons),"The type of parasites found in pigeon flocks are roundworms, hairworms and tapeworms, the latter being the least common. These survive by feeding in the intestines of the pigeon. As the name implies the hairworm is a hair-like parasite, very slender and long, with their eggs being the most infectious after 8 to 9 days. The hairworm is not a specific parasite to pigeons only, but can also infect other poultry species. The roundworm occurs only in pigeons, and its eggs become mostly infectious after 2 to 3 weeks. Tapeworms depend on intermediate hosts to be transmitted to pigeons. This can occur through the consumption of snails, ants or beetles.","Tapeworm infestation can be identified by examining the faeces for eggs or segments. However, other parasite infestations are only visible through microscopic examination of the faeces.","Period from ingestion of worm eggs to the first excretion of the eggs in faeces for; o Tapeworm is about 2 weeks o Hairworm is 3 to 4 weeks o Roundworm is 5 to 6 weeks ;Following 10 to 12 days of consumption of the eggs, droppings may vary in consistency and appearance. ;Initially, appetite increases, but upon progression of infestation it diminishes. ;Anorexia; weight loss ;General condition impaired: lifeless, laid-back, reluctance to fly. ;Ruffled feathers",;E.Coli infection ;Salmonellosis ;Coccidiosis,;Anthelmintic agents; fenbendazole,";All pigeons in the flock should be treated at the same time. ;Examine the faces for eggs or segments to ensure complete eradication. ;Do not treat if pigeon is nurturing the young or whilst in the main process of moulting. ;Do not leave any feed overnight due to the risk of contamination by insects. Apart from this precaution, feed and water bowls are to be cleaned thoroughly and make sure that no insects can access the loft."
Hexamitiasis (Pigeons),"Pigeons usually present with this disease due to the flagella, Hexamita columbae which affects the rectum. Flocks are mostly to become infected during the summer and autumn period. The incubation period is about 4 to 5 days.","Adult pigeons infected with hexamitiasis do not usually present with noticeable signs and symptoms, but it can be recognised because there is an increase in the quantity of droppings.",";Watery-like or bloody and noxious diarrhoea ;General condition impaired; reduced feed and increase water intake resulting in general malaise and malnutrition. ;Young pigeons; the entire intestines become involved with bloody diarrhoea, sometimes leading to death.",;E.coli infection ;Salmonellosis ;Coccidiosis ;Paramyxovirus infection,;Antiprotozoal agents; Dimetridazole ;Aminoglycosides antibiotics; Aminosidine sulphate,";It is important to treat all the pigeons living together at the same time. ;Do not dilute medication if there is the need to increase drinking water (for example, during the hot weather), but following medicated water provide fresh water. ;Do not provide bath water."
Calf scour,"Calves may develop scours due to bacterial or virus infections. Scours is known as ""calf scours"" or neonatal calf diarrhea. The primary causes of scours include: Rota virus, Corona virus, Cryptosporidium parvum, Salmonella and Escherichia coli.","Determine if treatment is required. Calves that are moving around in the pasture, with their tails up, probably do not need treatment. Check to see if the diarrhea is yellow or white. If this is the case, treatment is probably not needed. • Determine if the calf is looking listless. Calves that are lethargic or not participating much in the playful activities with other calves are a red flag to pay attention to. Calves that are also losing condition are also cause for alarm. • Check to see if the calf is dehydrated. You can check for dehydration by pulling on the calf's neck skin. If the skin ""tents"" this is a sign of dehydration. • Determine the calf's body temperature. A normal body temperature ranges from 100.5 °f (38.1 °c) to 102.5 °f (39.2 °c). Anything outside of this range is a sign for treatment. • Separate the sick calf or calves from the healthy herd. You'll want to do this to avoid spreading the disease further. • Administer fluids using your veterinarian-approved electrolyte solution. You may need to inject the fluids via iv or orally. • Follow appropriate nursing care protocol using your vet's guidelines. This may include providing shelter, feed and a warm place to sleep. • A drawback from providing shelter is maintaining infectious control. You will have to work extra to get rid of soiled bedding and disinfect everything that a calf will touch, from the floor to the fence panels and even the feed bucket. • Enthnovet practice: Ingredients needed: vasambu (Acorus calamus) leaves 2 numbers, dried ginger (Zingiber officinale) 50 gm, guava (Psidium guajava) tender leaves 200 gm. The above materials are ground and made into a bolus and administered orally one or two times.",,,,
Infectious catarrh,"Infectious catarrh is a disease of the respiratory tract which often results because of mixed infections (mycoplasma, viruses, fungi and trichomonads). The birds’ resistance to infection is reduced due to the pathogenic bacteria developed (pasteurella, cocci and coli bacteria) and also due to factors within the loft environment.",;Behaviour of the affected pigeon ;Inflammatory changes in the head region and respiratory tract ;Characteristic sound of respiration (example: wheezing) on first suspicion of the disease a veterinary examination is vital.,"Initial stage; ;Sneezing and aqueous nasal discharge Acute stage; ;Nasal discharge becoming mucopurulent and yellowish brown in colour ;General condition impaired; reduced feed and water intake, cessation of down moulting, reluctance to fly. ;Wattle and bridge of nose turn grey ;Beak opened: stringy mucus stretching from the retrolingual region to the palate ;Redding and swelling of pharyngeal mucosa Advanced stage; ;Inflammation extends to windpipe and lower respiratory tract ;Visible and audible catarrh (wheezing) ;White-yellow deposits in the laryngeal region",;ornithosis ;Trichomoniasis,";Pleuromutilin antibiotics; tiamulin, valnemulin ;Aminoglycoside antibiotics; lincomycin, spectinomycin, foramycin ;Tetracycline antibiotics; chlortetracycline ;Macrolide antibiotics; tylosin",";It is important to start treatment immediately upon appearance of first signs. ;Do not provide bath water. ;Do not give any feedstuffs containing calcium (as it binds to tetracycline antibiotics in turn reducing its efficacy). ;No free flight for affected pigeons. ;Remove factors within the loft which lower the resistance to pathogens; ventilation and waste-air extraction, deficient supply of oxygen, presence of noxious gases, dust in the loft, stocking density."
ornithosis (Pigeons),ornithosis is caused by Chlamydia psittaci micro organism through invading internal cells. Transmission of infection can occur; indirectly via inhalation of dust particles containing the pathogen and also directly by ingestion of contaminated food and water with faeces.,"This disease is very difficult to recognise since no clinical sign is definite for ornithosis. A swab either from the nose, eyes or the genital or anal area is taken to confirm diagnosis.","Acute form (occurs in young pigeons): ;Wheezing (recognised as pigeon breaths with half opened beak) ;Inflammation of one or both eyes (presented as redness, yellow crusts and pus covering the whole eye) ;Watery-like diarrhoea Chronic form (occurs in adult pigeons): ;Few or no signs shown",;Paramyxovirus infection ;Infectious catarrh ;Salmonellosis,";Tetracycline antibiotics; chlortetracycline, doxycycline ;Fluoroquinolone antibiotics; enrofloxacin",";Pigeons which are chronic carriers (ie.

African Swine Fever,"African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs, whose mortality rate can reach 100%. It is not a danger to human health, but it has devastating effects on pig populations and the farming economy.
The virus is highly resistant in the environment, meaning that it can survive on clothes, boots, wheels, and other materials. It can also survive in various pork products, such as ham, sausages or bacon. Therefore, human behaviours can play an important role in spreading this pig disease across borders if adequate measures are not taken.","This diseases can affect pigs of any age. High mortality rates. The key clinical signs include blue-purple cyanosis of snout, ears, tail and lower legs; high fever; and heavy discharge from eyes and nose. This disease is notifiable -contact your vet and local authorities if you believe this disease is affecting your herd.","• High fever 40-42°C. • Loss of appetite. • Depression. • Lethargic- sometimes refusal to stand or move. • Very unsteady when stood up. • Vomiting and/or diarrhoea with bloody discharge. • White skinned pigs: extremities (nose, ears, tail and lower legs) become cyanotic (blue-purple colour). • Discrete haemorrhages appear in the skin particularly on the ears and flanks. • Group will huddle together and are usually shivering. • Abnormal breathing. • Heavy discharge from eyes and/or nose. • Comatose state and death within a few days. • Some pigs can show conjunctivitis with reddening of the conjunctival mucosa and ocular discharges. Pregnant sows commonly undergo miscarriage or deliver stillborn piglets that are malformed -piglets can be tested for the virus. Mortality rate in infected groups of pigs is high and there is no vaccination proven to prevent or cure infection, therefore, it is crucial that control begins on-farm. European, South American and Caribbean countries which have been infected have adopted a slaughter policy to eradicate the virus within the herd. Mild strains of the virus also occur which cause a milder but equally serious disease in domestic pig herds -individuals from these herds must also be slaughtered to prevent pathogenesis. Pigs that die early in an outbreak may not have any noticeable lesions but as the disease progresses the lesions then are striking. Bright red haemorrhages in the lymph nodes, kidneys, heart and linings of the body cavities are common findings. There may also be excess haemorrhagic fluid in the body cavities and gelatinous fluid in the lungs. The spleen may be enlarged, darkened and crumble on slight pressure.",,There is no treatment. All infected animals must be isolated and culled immediately upon confirmation of presence of the virus.,"There is no live or attenuated vaccine for the prevention of ASF therefore control of the virus is reliant on strict biosecurity. • Do not feed domestic pigs food waste; this is illegal in the UK, other EU regions and some states within the US • Where ‘permitted garbage feeding’ is legal in US states, pigs fed this way are prohibited from exportation. • Do not leave food waste exposed for wild swine species to access. Dispose of food waste properly. • Abide by strict biosecurity rules. Do not take pig meat onto farms, or restrict all food (and consumption of food) to a canteen. All staff on farm should be inducted onto a strict programme of hand and equipment sanitisation before and after contact with pigs. • Follow rules and regulations on disposal of food waste at ferry ports and airports. • Provide the means for staff and visitors to thoroughly sanitise their hands and equipment. • Ensure that wild boar, warthogs and wild pigs, and materials potentially contaminated by such wild species do not come into contact with domestic pigs. • Check infected regions before import of goods that could potentially be contaminated. • Advise and educate people on the risks of bringing back pork products from infected regions."
Paramyxovirus infection (Pigeons),"This infection can be contracted only by pigeons and not by any other bird species. Infected pigeons shed the virus via secretions from mucous membranes (eyes, nose and throat) and also in faeces.","The virus is detected through tissue samples and swabs taken from suspected pigeons. It is best to be recognised during the initial incubation period, since afterwards it may lead to death.",Incubation period of the infection: 3 to 21 days Initial signs; ;Reduced intake of feed and increased water uptake ;Anorexia ;Faeces present in a puddle due to increased water excretion Following some days into incubation period; ;Paralysis of one or both legs ;Reserved ;Torsion of the neck ;Twisting movement of the body ;Walking in reverse ;Death,;Salmonellosis,No treatment for viral diseases.,";About 30% of the infected pigeons may recover on their own following 4 weeks of infection. ;Support viral infection and other pigeons in the flock by vitamin, herbal extracts, ginseng and amino acid supplements. ;Vaccination should take place if viral infection is suspected in a flock, even in pigeons which appear unaffected, as to avoid spreading of the virus. This is the most effective way of preventing and controlling infection by the paramyxovirus. ;However, affected birds which show symptoms of infection should be selected and separated from the entire flock and cannot be vaccinated."
Pigeon Pox,This viral infectious disease is characterised by changes on the skin and mucous membranes of the pigeons. It cannot be transmitted to humans or other mammals. Its incidence is greater in humid and warm weather.,Disease last for about 3 to 4 weeks; if pigeon is malnourished it can also lasts for several months. Both forms of the pigeon pox can be clearly recognised because both scaly skin and lumps are visible.,"Skin form; ;Scaly skin develops especially around the eyes and beak (where mucous membranes meet the skin), and also on the legs. It can be clearly identified from normal skin. ;Virus enters the skin through lesions such as scratches or insect bites Mucosal form; ;Lumps develop in the throat; these may impair food and water intake and breathing. ;Can be confused with canker but can be easily distinguished as these lumps form part of the tissue underneath.

Classical Swine Fever,This diseases can affect pigs of any age. High mortality rates. The key clinical signs include conjunctivitis; high fever; and heavy discharge from eyes and nose. This disease is notifiable -contact your vet and local authorities if you believe this disease is affecting your herd. Pigs,,"The virus that causes CSF varies in virulence. Some strains are highly virulent and cause acute (i.e. rapid) serious disease. Some strains are of low virulence and cause chronic (i.e. long-lasting) disease, others are intermediate causing sub-acute disease. Acute disease • Clinical signs usually appear first in a small number of growing pigs which show non-specific signs of depression, sleepiness, and reluctance to get up or to eat. If you get them up they may wander to the feeder but eat very little or nothing and wander away again to lie down. They walk and stand with their heads down and tails limp. over the following few days these signs get worse and more pigs become affected. • Younger piglets may appear chilled, shiver and huddle together. • Initially affected pigs may appear to be constipated but this generally changes to a yellow-grey diarrhoea as the disease progresses. Early on some of the pigs may develop conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eye surface) with thin discharges. This gets worse, the discharge getting thicker with time until some of the eyelids are completely closed and adhered. • A constant early sign, which persists throughout the disease until just before death, is a high fever, over 42ºC (107ºF). Check the sick pigs' rectal temperatures. If they are all high suspect CSF. • As the disease progresses the affected pigs become very thin and weak and develop a staggering walk. Initially this is probably through weakness but later it is due to infection of and damage to the spinal nerves. Partial paralysis of the hind end results in a drunken walk and a tendency to fall to a sitting or lying position. Diarrhoea worsens and some pigs vomit a yellowish bile. The pigs' skins go purple, first over the ears and tail, followed by the snout, lower legs, belly and back. Affected pigs die in 10-20 days. Some pigs go into convulsions before death. Sub-acute disease The early signs in growing pigs are similar but they progress more slowly and are less severe. Affected pigs may be ill for up to 30 days before they die. Chronic and aberrant disease and persistent infection The virus can cross the placenta and infect the piglets in the sow's uterus. Sows that have been inadequately vaccinated that become infected, or sows which become infected with a virus of low virulence, may appear normal but give birth to shaking piglets many of which die. (Note: there are also other causes of shaking or trembling piglets). If the virus crosses the placenta before the piglets' immune systems have developed they may be born apparently healthy although possibly weak and may grow on to be persistent carriers without at first showing clinical signs. They shed virus so they are a menace to other pigs. At several weeks or months of age they may develop typical clinical signs but these are likely to be milder, last longer and without the high temperatures. Virus that infects the piglets in the uterus may cause other effects, namely, death, mummification, abortion or the birth of weak piglets some of which may be deformed. Vaccination of sows during pregnancy with some of the original attenuated virus vaccines resulted in trans-placental infection of unborn piglets with similar adverse results. The newer attenuated vaccines are claimed to be safer. Low virulence strains of the virus may also multiply in the reproductive tracts of unvaccinated boars or boars which have been inadequately vaccinated. The vaccine virus itself in some of the older attenuated vaccines was thought to do this, resulting in returns to service and abortions. Diagnosis In acute or sub-acute outbreaks a presumptive diagnosis can be made on the typical clinical signs and post-mortem lesions but African swine fever and Salmonella choleraesuis infection produce some similar signs and lesions. Salmonella choleraesuis is frequently a concurrent pathological infection with CSF virus, triggered off from its latent state by the CSF virus infection. In chronic or aberrant cases the clinical signs and lesions are less diagnostic and may only raise a suspicion of CSF. Fever, Conjunctivitis,
purplish discolouration of
snout, ears, abdomen,
inner side of the legs and
staggering gait.",,There is no treatment.,"Vaccination • Inactivated vaccines on-farm precautions • If you farm in a country where CSF is endemic or where there is a risk of CSF occurring consider routinely vaccinating your herd if vaccination is allowed. This will greatly reduce the possibility of contamination. • CSF virus does not spread as readily as some other viral infections (e.g. TGE and FMD). Unlike FMD it is not windborne. Thus the conscientious application of simple biosecurity measures should keep it out of the herd. • If CSF is in your country important precautions include reducing visitors to a minimum, taking precautions against contamination from vehicles, and not allowing pig meat products near any pigs. • Any replacement pigs coming on to the premises should come from known safe sources and should be quarantined. In some areas the disease has become very mild and spread can go unrecognised. • Pig buildings should be protected from stray animals, particularly wild pigs and boars. Vaccination of susceptible
animals. Restriction on
animal movement, strict
biosecurity measures and
proper disposal of carcass"
Salmonellosis=Paratyphus,"This infectious bacterial disease has the highest mortality rate amongst pigeons.

Canine Coronavirus,This is an intestinal infection that is highly contagious and affects both wild and domesticated dogs. The virus is limited to the upper two thirds of the small intestines. A lot of the time there may be no symptoms and the infection will clear up by itself. However this infection can be problematic for puppies and dogs that have other infections such as parvovirus.,,"It is common in older dogs for there to be no symptoms, but when there are symptoms these include vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.

Wet Droppings (Pigeons),"The pigeons’ state of health can be analysed through the appearance, composition and smell of the faeces. Normal gut contents leave the intestinal tract in the form of a paste (like toothpaste) as contents thicken during their way out and urine is thickened and excreted as uric acid crystals with faeces appearing as white constituents. Changes in faeces can be due to many possible causes such as; ;Change of weather; low temperature, humidity, drafts. ;Psychological stress; racing season, agitation of individual pigeon, vaccinations, exhibitions, changes in the loft layout and feeding times. ;Disturbance in the fluid balance leading to loss of water, minerals and trace elements; changes in type of feed, intolerance to certain feed.","It is very easy to recognise by analysing the appearance, composition and smell of the faeces.",;Faeces not thickened; gut contents spend less time in the intestine ;Urine not thickened because of increased volume (due to excessive water intake) ;Result: Diarrhoea or wet droppings,;Paramyxovirus infection ;E.Coli infection ;Salmonellosis ;Coccidiosis,N/A,";Eliminate any of the possible causes which can result in wet droppings. o Avoid temperature changes, especially in the very hot and very cold months; use air-extractors. o Avoid changes in the loft layout and feeding times. o Provide supplements for stress which pigeons develop before a race. o Take care when changing type of food; inspect faeces produced by pigeons for any intolerance to any ingredient in the feed. ;Diarrhoea results in loss of water, minerals and trace elements. It is important to replace this loss to stabilise the flora of the gut; use electrolytes. ;Do not provide bath water."
Milk fever,"Milk fever, also known as Parturient hypocalcaemia and parturient paresis, is a disease which has assumed considerable importance with the development of heavy milking cows. Decrease in the levels of ionized calcium in tissue fluids is basically the cause of the disease. In all adult cows, there is a fall in serum-calcium level with the onset of lactation at calving. The disease usually occurs in 5 to 10 year-old cows, and is chiefly caused by a sudden decrease in blood-calcium level, generally within 48 hours after calving.",,"• in classical cases, hypocalcaemia is the cause of clinical symptoms. Hypophosphataemia and variations in the concentration of serum magnesium may play some subsidiary role. • the clinical symptoms develop usually in one to three days after calving. They are characterized by loss of appetite, constipation and restlessness, but there is no rise in temperature.",,,
Leptospirosis,"Leptospirosis is caused by a bacteria and is usually contracted from contaminated water, so try and prevent your dog from drinking out of any puddles, ponds, lakes, reservoirs or canals. The bacteria mainly comes from the urine of rats, pigs and cattle, which makes farms the most likely place for the disease to be transmitted.",,"High temperature, loss of appetite, vomiting, lethargy, depression, muscle pain, diarrhoea and blood in the urine.

Ranikhet Disease,"Ranikhet disease, also known in the West as Newcastle disease is a contagious and highly fatal daises of flows. In spite of the notable work done towards its control, this disease still ranks as one of the most serious virus diseases of poultry. The disease occurs in almost all countries and usually assumes a server form affecting birds of all ages. Mortality in flows varies from 50 to 100 per cent. Ranikhet disease is largely a disease of flows, but it also effects turkeys, pigenosn, grows, ducks, geese, koel pheasants, guinea-flows, partridges and doves. hedgehogs have been suspected as reservoirs of the disease. The disease is also suspected to cause conjunctivitis among laboratory workers and persons handling infected birds.",,"The symptoms vary according to the age of the affected birds. The first symptoms usually observed in young birds are sneezing, gasping and often droopiness. It is in this stage of the disease that the manifestations rather closely resemble those of infections bronchitis. Within a short time after appearance of respiratory symptoms, deaths occur in a flock in quick succession and in increasing numbers from day to day. Among growing birds and in adult sudden deaths occur in a dew instances, and are followed by a number of birds showing respiratory symptoms. The affected birds are full and depressed with ruffled feathers. These symptoms are accompanied by diarrhea, characterize by the passing of a watery stool with an offensive smell. There is profuse salivation. The saliva often accumulates in the mouth and obstructs respiration, which results in the production of gurgling disused birds may be soft - shelled and deformed. In turkeys the disease runs a very mild course. In adults, in particular, it may pass unnoticed except for some dullness, loss of appetite and other minor symptoms.",,,Control of Ranikhet diseases can be effect with judicious application of sanitary and vaccination measures.

IBD- Infectious Bursal Disease,"A viral disease, seen worldwide, which targets the bursal component of the immune system of chickens. In addition to the direct economic effects of the clinical disease, the damage caused to the immune system interacts with other pathogens to cause significant effects. The age up to which infection can cause serious immunosuppression varies between 14 and 28 days according to the antigen in question. Generally speaking the earlier the damage occurs the more severe the effects.",,• Depression. • Inappetance. • Unsteady gait. • Huddling under equipment. • Vent pecking. • Diarrhoea with urates in mucus.,,No specific treatment is available. Use of a multivitamin supplement and facilitating access to water may help. Antibiotic medication may be indicated if secondary bacterial infection occurs.,"Vaccination, including passive protection via breeders, vaccination of progeny depending on virulence and age of challenge. In most countries breeders are immunised with a live vaccine at 6-8 weeks of age and then re-vaccinated with an oil-based inactivated vaccine at 18 weeks. A strong immunity follows field challenge. Immunity after a live vaccine can be poor if maternal antibody was still high at the time of vaccination. When outbreaks do occur, biosecurity measures may be helpful in limiting the spread between sites, and tracing of contacts may indicate sites on which a more rebust vaccination programme is indicated."
MAREKS DISEASE,"Marek's disease is a Herpes virus infection of chickens, and rarely turkeys in close association with chickens, seen worldwide. From the 1980s and 1990s highly virulent strains have become a problem in North America and Europe. The disease has various manifestations: a) Neurological - Acute infiltration of the CNS and nerves resulting in 'floppy broiler syndrome' and transient paralysis, as well as more long-standing paralysis of legs or wings and eye lesions; b) Visceral - Tumours in heart, ovary, tests, muscles, lungs; c) Cutaneous - Tumours of feather follicles. Morbidity is 10-50% and mortality up to 100%. Mortality in an affected flock typically continues at a moderate or high rate for quite a few weeks. In 'late' Marek's the mortality can extend to 40 weeks of age. Affected birds are more susceptible to other diseases, both parasitic and bacterial. The route of infection is usually respiratory and the disease is highly contagious being spread by infective feather-follicle dander, fomites, etc. Infected birds remain viraemic for life. Vertical transmission is not considered to be important. The virus survives at ambient temperature for a long time (65 weeks) when cell associated and is resistant to some disinfectants (quaternary ammonium and phenol). It is inactivated rapidly when frozen and thawed.",,"• Paralysis of legs, wings and neck. • Loss of weight. • Grey iris or irregular pupil. • Vision impairment. • Skin around feather follicles raised and roughened.",,None.,"Hygiene, all-in/all-out production, resistant strains, vaccination generally with 1500 PFU of HVT at day old (but increasingly by in-ovo application at transfer), association with other strains (SB1 Sero-type 2) and Rispen's. It is common practice to use combinations of the different vaccine types in an effort to broaden the protection achieved. Genetics can help by increasing the frequency of the B21 gene that confers increased resistance to Marek's disease challenge."
FoWL PoX,"Avian pox, caused by a poxvirus, is one of the oldest known infectious disease of birds. There are many different strains of the avian pox virus but most are species specific. However, some strains have the ability to infect birds across different families. While avian pox infections in wild birds are often mild and self-limiting, some
outbreaks cause high mortality rates. Birds native to isolated islands are
particularly susceptible to this disease. In Hawaii, avian pox has negatively
impacted many species of native birds. Avian pox can lead to significant losses
when many captive birds are housed in close quarters. The virus can also spread
between wild and captive birds (see Transmission).",,"Avian pox develops slowly in affected birds. The most common clinical sign of avian pox is the formation of wart-like growths on the skin, particularly on unfeathered parts of the body such as the legs, feet, eyelids, base of the beak, and the comb and wattles. This is the cutaneous or “dry” form of avian pox. Birds with mild infections may only have a few growths that minimally affect their health status. These lesions can persist from 1 to 4 weeks but in most cases, the bird will survive and the nodules will heal potentially with some scarring. At times, nodules on the eyes can interfere with the bird’s ability to see food or predators and can lead to death. Mortality can also result from secondary bacterial infections that are common with this disease. In more severe cases, birds may develop yellow-white, cheese-like lesions in their mouths and upper respiratory tract (this is known as the diphtheritic or “wet” form of the disease) which can lead to decreased food intake, difficulty breathing, and death.",,"There is no known treatment for avian pox in wild birds. In captive birds, a variety of treatments have been used along with supportive cate to treat the pox lesions and prevent secondary infections. These methods will not eliminate the virus, and the disease will run its course with or without treatment.",

Heat Stroke (Cattle),"The condition involves the increase of body temperature to an extreme point. Unreasonably high temperatures in an animal that seemed completely healthy a few hours ago would be above 106ºF-107°F. Therefore, on a very hot and humid summer day, it would be wise—indeed, necessary—to check an animal that is down or otherwise depressed to see what her temperature is. Most times, a typical heat stroke will be 106°F-108°F. If the temperature is above 108°F, like 109°F-110°F, the cow (or horse) will either not recover fully or recover at all since that level of temperature causes brain damage. Check the temperature of the worst-affected animal to know where she is on the temperature spectrum. on the worst days, normal cows will have elevated temperatures in the range of 103°F or so when they are coming in from pasture or when in the barnyard congregated together. Simple heat stress can deteriorate into heat stroke in animals that have had pneumonia at some point in the past (look in the health record) or in just-fresh older cows with low blood calcium levels.",,"Fever: 41 -42C - Dry skin, bloody eye mucus membrane - High pulse and respiratory rates. - Convulsive",,"- Keep the cattle in cool and windy place; continuously irrigate cool water into the rectum. - Spray cool water on the body and use fan. - If the cow is convulsive or nervous, we have to take the blood out from the jugular vein to prevent congestion and lung edema. - Medical treatment: + Infuse NaHCo3 500ml + Give drinking water mixing with NaHCo3 in hot season + Anagin 1ml/20kg weight + Caffeine 1ml/20kg weight + B-complex, Vitamin C - Give 5 liter of green tea water (100 gram dried green tea or 500 gram fresh tea with one liter of hot water, add 500 gram of sugar + 4 liter of clean water).

other lungworm infections occur but are less common.

Species of Dictyocaulus belong to the superfamily Trichostrongyloidea and have direct life cycles. E aerophilus belongs to the Trichuroidea and is thought to have a direct life cycle. other species belong to the Metastrongyloidea superfamily and, except for o osleri, have indirect life cycles. Some nematodes that inhabit the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation, eg, Angiostrongylus vasorum and Dirofilaria immitis, which affect both dogs and cats in certain areas of the world, may be associated with pulmonary disease. Clinical signs relate to a cardiac or pulmonary disease, or a combination of both may occur.",,"sed by string worm parasitizing in treache and bronchi. - Usually on 3 -6 month old calf - Coughing, depressed respiration, nasal discharge (sometimes with blood) - Glassy, high respiration, drink less water.",,"njection, 4ml/50kg weight - Mevenbet or Levamisol, injection, 2ml/10kg weight",

Pnuemonia (Cattle),"Pneumonia refers to inflammation of the lungs. It may be accompanied by inflammation of the larger airways (bronchioles) and referred to as bronchopneumonia, or by inflammation of the pleura (outer surface of the lung, adjacent to the chest wall) and referred to as pleuropneumonia.

Pneumonia in cattle is often caused by infectious agents, particularly by a combination of bacteria and viruses. Pneumonia in cattle, also known as bovine respiratory disease (BRD), is influenced by a complex causal web involving a range of animal, management, and agent factors. The presence of infectious agents alone may not be sufficient to cause disease. Many potential stressors associated with the export process can predispose cattle to pneumonia including transportation, mixing of cattle from different sources, dietary changes and reduction in feed and/or water intake, changes in weather, dust and other respiratory irritants such as ammonia, and alterations in ventilation. The rapid, deep, open mouth breathing associated with heat stress is believed to facilitate the inhalation of organisms deep into the airways.

A number of viral, bacterial, and Mycoplasma pathogens may be involved. Many are normal inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract of cattle that can become serious opportunistic pathogens.

Infectious agents associated with BRD include:
Viruses: bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1 or IBR), parainfluenza virus type-3 (PI-3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVD), and adenoviruses.
Bacteria: Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Salmonella sp., and Mycoplasma sp.
The most common form of severe BRD is a bacterial bronchopneumonia involving one or more of the bacterial agents identified above. The viruses (and perhaps Mycoplasma) are thought to be initial infective agents that act to compromise respiratory defence mechanisms and allow the bacteria to penetrate into the lower airways and alveoli causing more severe disease.

Serious outbreaks of pneumonia occur sometimes in the export process, especially on long sea voyages. The full extent of disease is usually only appreciated when the lungs of slaughtered animals are examined at necropsy or processing.",,"ver 40-41 C - Glassy, exhausted, no appetite, tearing, nasal discharge - Depressed respiration, abnormal breathing sound - Coughing, especially in night time and early morning.",,"ecause this is a bacteria disease, we use antibiotics for treatment: - Penicilin 15.000 UI/1kg weight + Streptomycin 5-10mg/kg weight - Kanamycin 1ml/10kg weight - Ampi-kana 10mg/kg weight - Tylosin 1ml/10kg weight - Gentamycin 6-8ml/100kg weight Muscle injection, continue in 3-5 days, twice a day. Besides, we can additionally treat with anti-fever, caffeine, etc.",
Acidosis,"A sudden change in diet to high concentrate (rapidly fermentable) grains builds lactic acid in the gut, which can cause organ damage.
